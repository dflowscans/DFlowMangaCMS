# DFlowMangaCMS
A custom MangaCMS built on NET.ASP MVC and Razor pages.

#### Note: Only this README will be updated. The others you see in this repo will NOT be updated.

## Compiling the code:
#### Note: This is not neccessary but it is recommended as sometimes I'll probably forget to compile it myself and you'll be using an older version.
#### Note: All commands should be run in the root directory of the project.

To get started run:
```
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -o .\publish
```

This will generate the following folders:
- bin
- publish
- wwwroot
